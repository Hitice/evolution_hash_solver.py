Hash Evolution Solver explores non-standard mathematical formulas to solve user-provided 32-bit hashes. Using evolutionary algorithms and multi-core processing, the program evolves formulas over millions of generations, offering a unique experimental approach to hash solving.

# Hash Evolution Solver

This project implements an evolutionary algorithm to find mathematical formulas that produce specific hash values. Instead of using conventional cryptographic functions like SHA-256, this program explores different non-standard mathematical formulas.

## How it Works

1. The program starts with a random population of formulas.
2. Each formula is applied to an input value, and the hash is calculated.
3. The goal is to evolve a formula that matches the target hash value provided by the user.
4. The algorithm runs for a defined number of iterations or until the correct formula is found.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hash_evolution_project.git
   cd hash_evolution_project
